# Mintify Landing Page

This is a simple landing page project that I built while learning frontend development. The goal of this project was to practice HTML and CSS by recreating a modern-style landing page layout with different sections, cards, and media elements.

## What I Learned

While building this project, I learned several new concepts:

* How to use **mask-image** to create fade effects.
* How to control **opacity** for better visual design.
* How to use the **video tag** in HTML.
* How to design and structure **different types of cards**.
* How to organize sections of a landing page properly.

## Problems I Faced

During the development, I ran into multiple issues:

* I struggled with positioning elements correctly.
* Mask effects were confusing at first.
* Some CSS properties didn’t work as expected.
* I lost track of changes while working locally.

## How I Solved Them

* I asked questions in the community.
* I learned new terms and techniques from other developers.
* I experimented with different CSS properties until things worked.
* I used Git to manage and recover my project.

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand real-world layout building and improved my confidence in HTML and CSS. I also learned how important it is to ask for help and learn from the community.
